Like:
- mob.sh: easy, no-nonsense +2
- learning together: going together through the tutorial
- nice to be back at it after a couple of weeks
- fast decide what to do (default to action?)

Learn:
- Canvas +2
- Basic animation
- mob.sh applies to much more situations, 
    a lot more flexible
        - use your own screenshare, 
        - your own editor settings, 
        - private repo
- 5 minutes is short for a setup with share screen switch
- Switching: has to setup the context again (annoying)

Like:
- mob.sh: fluent switching +1
- 7 minute interval worked well in this setup +1
- Group dynamic is fluid +2


Learn:
- Drawing on the canvas +2
- Step-by-step build up of the game +2
- Having the same set up on everyone's system really helps +2

# Options

1. Test set up 
1. Cover it with tests
2. Start from scratch

Like:
- jest without the dom is fine
- chatting

Learn:
- Testing jest dom requires a lot of fancy libraries +2
- Google is key to find solutions
- npm experience is painful (random failure, rabbit hole) +1
- jest coverage command

Things to try next time:

- Is the setInterval doing something? (done)
- Use docker to run the tests (done)

- What about the click and key handlers? Mock the handlers or call the functions?

- Try vscode refactorings
- Try Gitduck

Like:
- It worked in the end (despite the tech trouble) +2
- Trying something different then usual
- Golden master for images +2

Learned:
- Javascript libraries often suck (especially around canvas)
- snapshotting a canvas
- while doing research, 10 minutes interval switching is fast. Still worked in the edn.
- Zoom is always in the way when we switch
- Less strict about changes to the code, but only adding reset and export. Compared to the trip service kata.


2020-11-24:

Like:
- Docker went smooth +2
- Test with snapshot more predictable in docker
- No strict timing on research / setup -- Would not have worked
- We are used to working together has less chaos

Learned:
- A repeatable environment helps a lot
- Mocking the dom hard, should be avoided if possible
- Less experienced team would have split
- Looking is also learning
- Jest Mocking
