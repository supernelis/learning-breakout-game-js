Like:
- mob.sh: easy, no-nonsense +2
- learning together: going together through the tutorial
- nice to be back at it after a couple of weeks
- fast decide what to do (default to action?)

Learn:
- Canvas +2
- Basic animation
- mob.sh applies to much more situations, 
    a lot more flexible
        - use your own screenshare, 
        - your own editor settings, 
        - private repo
- 5 minutes is short for a setup with share screen switch
- Switching: has to setup the context again (annoying)
