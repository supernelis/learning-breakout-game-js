Like:
- mob.sh: easy, no-nonsense +2
- learning together: going together through the tutorial
- nice to be back at it after a couple of weeks
- fast decide what to do (default to action?)

Learn:
- Canvas +2
- Basic animation
- mob.sh applies to much more situations, 
    a lot more flexible
        - use your own screenshare, 
        - your own editor settings, 
        - private repo
- 5 minutes is short for a setup with share screen switch
- Switching: has to setup the context again (annoying)

Things to try next time:
- Is the setInterval doing something?
- What about the document handles? Mock the handlers or call the functions?
- Try Gitduck
- Try vscode refactorings

Like:
- It worked in the end (despite the tech trouble) +2
- Trying something different then usual
- Golden master for images +2

Learned:
- Javascript libraries often suck (especially around canvas)
- snapshotting a canvas
- while doing research, 10 minutes interval switching is fast. Still worked in the edn.
- Zoom is always in the way when we switch
- Less strict about changes to the code, but only adding reset and export. Compared to the trip service kata.
